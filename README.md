The Traction was built by a team of 5 junior developers as the capstone project of the immersive Momentum Learning, Inc. coding program.  The app seeks to aid the NC Harm Reduction Coalition and other groups in fighting the opioid crisis. It organizes community volunteers, captures data, and tracks the distribution of Naloxone (Narcan) kits utilizing QR codes. It vastly improves the efficiency and security of data collection and analysis.
